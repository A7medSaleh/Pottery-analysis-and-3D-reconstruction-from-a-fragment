This code analyzes any fragment 2D profile to reconstruct its 3D body. It also calculates and describes the profile as a function of the arc distance from a reference point where the reference point lies at the zero point. We use three different mathematical representations to describe the morphology of the curves: the radius, the tangent and the curvature. Mathematically speaking, each of the three representations of the profile stores the entire morphological information of the curve.

This can be used in Computerized morphological classification of ceramics and pottery fragments found by archaeologists. Also can be used in any 3D reconstruction of a body from its fragment.

The code is implemented in a GUI (user friendly) to facilitate using the program and it runs on MATLAB platform.
